# DSA in Java - Learning and Problem Solving Repository  

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! This repository is a collection of my Java programs, showcasing my journey in mastering DSA concepts and improving my problem-solving skills. As I continue to explore new topics, this repository reflects my learning process and growth. I am committed to enhancing my problem-solving abilities, and I keep adding new DSA implementations every week to expand my knowledge.

## Repository Overview  

This repository includes solutions and implementations for the following topics:  
- **Linked Lists**  
- **Merge Sort**  
- **Recursion**  
- **Stacks**  
- Solutions to fundamental and intermediate DSA problems  

## Folder Structure  

The repository is organized into folders based on topics, with each folder containing relevant Java files:  

### **LinkedList/java/in**  
- **LinkedList.java**: Implementation of a singly linked list with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.  

### **MergeSort/java/in**  
- **MergeSort.java**: Standard implementation of Merge Sort using the divide-and-conquer technique.  
- **MergeSort2.java**: An alternate approach to implementing Merge Sort with additional examples.  

### **Recursion/Java/in**  
- **CheckSortedArray.java**: Program to check if an array is sorted using recursion.  
- **Factorial.java**: Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.  
- **Fibonacci.java**: Program to find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.  
- **FindXpowerN.java**: Calculate \(x^n\) using recursion.  
- **FirstOccurrence.java**: Find the first occurrence of an element in an array using recursion.  
- **LastOccurrence.java**: Find the last occurrence of an element in an array using recursion.  
- **PrintNumberInDecOrder.java**: Print numbers from \(n\) to 1 in decreasing order.  
- **PrintNumberIncrOrder.java**: Print numbers from 1 to \(n\) in increasing order.  
- **SumOfNaturalNumbers.java**: Calculate the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers using recursion.  

### **Stack/java/in**  
- **InsertAtBottom.java**: Insert an element at the bottom of a stack using recursion.  
- **LinkedListUsingStack.java**: Simulate a linked list using a stack.  
- **ReverseStack.java**: Reverse a stack using recursion.  
- **ReverseStringUsingStack.java**: Reverse a string using a stack.  
- **StackCollectionFramework.java**: Demonstration of Java's `Stack` class from the collection framework.  
- **StackUsingArrayList.java**: Implementation of a stack using Java's `ArrayList`.
