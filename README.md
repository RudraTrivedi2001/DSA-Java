# DSA in Java - Learning and Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! This repo is a work-in-progress collection of programs that reflect my journey in mastering DSA using Java. I update it regularly as I learn new concepts and improve my problem-solving skills.  

## Repository Overview

This repository contains:  
- Implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures.  
- Solutions to common DSA problems and challenges.  
- A log of my continuous progress in learning DSA and improving coding efficiency.

## Current Topics Implemented

### Data Structures
1. **Stack**  
   - Implementation of stack using arrays.  
   - Common operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and checking for underflow/overflow.  

2. **Linked List**  
   - Singly Linked List: Node creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal.  
   - Additional problems: Reversing a linked list, detecting cycles.  

3. **Sorting Algorithms**  
   - **MergeSort**: Implementation of divide-and-conquer sorting with examples.  

### Recursion
- Implementation of recursive solutions for common problems, including:  
  - Calculating factorial of a number.  
  - Finding the nth Fibonacci number.  
  - Solving the Tower of Hanoi problem.  
  - Recursively reversing a string or an array.  

### Problem Solving
- Basic DSA questions to build a strong foundation.  
- Examples include finding duplicates in an array, reversing a string using a stack, and merging two sorted linked lists.
