	ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement:
	You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.
	You need to return the **maximum profit** you can achieve from this transaction.
	You may **buy** and **sell** only once.

	âœ… Example 1:
	Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
	Output: 5
	Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.

	âœ… Example 2:
	Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
	Output: 0
	Explanation: No transactions can be made since the prices only decrease.
